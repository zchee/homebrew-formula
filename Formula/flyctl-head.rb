  # Upstream tags versions like `v0.1.92` and `v2023.9.8` but, as of writing,
  # they only create releases for the former and those are the versions we use
  # in this formula. We could omit the date-based versions using a regex but
  # this uses the `GithubLatest` strategy, as the upstream repository also
  # contains over a thousand tags (and growing).
